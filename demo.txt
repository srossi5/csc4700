What is your favorite movie?
	The Grand Budapest Hotel
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
	I would go to Japan
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
	I would have the power to control the elements, just like the Avatar. I want this because as a kid my favorite show was Avatar and
	being able to control water, earth, fire, and air would be super OP.
